# Kid-Icarus-AHK-Overhaul
Some scripts and files for a better Kid Icarus Uprising experience on Citra!  

Hello World! This is some stuff I've been working on!  
I wanted to make Kid Icarus Uprising feel not just playable, but maybe even accessible on PC. To this end, I've made an Citra config and AutoHotKey script for easy mouse & keyboard play!  

To use these files properly, make sure you have AutoHotKey and Citra 3DS emulator installed.  

Make an input profile in Citra and map according to the "input-remap.jpg" file!  
Make sure to read the controls by opening "KICitra.ahk" in Notepad!  
When you've got Kid Icarus Uprising ready to play on Citra, start up "KICitra.ahk" in AutoHotKey!  

EXTRAS:  
In the "Steam-graphics" folder you can find some nice assets to make a nice and pretty Steam shortcut  
To make an easy launcher, you can code a batch file to open Citra (or the game file itself) and KICitra.ahk at the same time.  
I may make a tutorial on more things including batch file making and controller setup with Steam, but for now I just wanna put this out here!
